This is where I will be writing from now on, nothing specific, but hopefully mostly code related.

I havent had much motivation these last few days so I'm trying to make maintaining my streak on github as easy as possibl.

as long as I can maintain an unbroken streak, I can come back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can also use this place to list ideas for future coding projects

Finally got myself to focus, The basic Abacus test function is finished and working.

I think I want to expand it into an entire math handling library, but that is a long term goal, for now Ill just settle on solving a few equations here and there.
