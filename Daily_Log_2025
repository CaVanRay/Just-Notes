10/15/25

Today is a good day, but a small part of me still feels off. Nothing serious, just kind of an unsure feeling like an on-going dream that I'm already forgetting the start of

I just need to survive the next 3 hours, and then I'll make some dinner and try to go to bed early

Fuck, I ate way too much

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/14/25

No idea why yesterday was so fucked up, but it's behind me and I survived, just need to figure out what I'm making for dinner tonight now

figured it out, Dinner was a peanut butter sandwich

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/13/25

Fuck this day

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/12/25

I need to take a break from drinking, it feels like everytime I have more than a beer I have trouble with my anxiety for a time afterwards
Something needs to change, I'm making progress, but I wish I was further along

Goals:
    Move to maws house
    Learn to develop my own games

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/11/25

Solid weekend, last night I got to drink but not too much, this morning I got up at 8, drank some coffee, read my book, and now I've got something I want to work on -
a basic game engine

Also, got to send a happy birthday message to Aphro, later I wanna try to call Dad & then Mom.

Tonight, I'm ordering taco bell

Ok, I need to write something before it gets too late

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/10/25

at work, smooth sailing so far, talked about plants with Brenda and then started looking up info about c++ references and templates

I'm finally home, I have scotch and a pizza is cooking, and I know my goal project

I am going to build a bare bones basic game engine

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/09/25

Just woke up, it's like 69 degrees outside, winter is coming

This week is taking forever, I need a vacation

back home, winding down, only one day left


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/08/25

Ive gotten a ton done already and it's not even 2 yet, downside I'm fasting until tomorrow and if i can't distract myself this is going to take forever

My brain is melting out of my ears, I'm having a bowl of pasta and a beer with a cig, jesus I'm exhausted

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/07/25

I really need to figure out some way to not feel like shit in the morning

I also need to lose weight, this is getting too close to the line for comfort

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/06/25

Today was a good day, got a ton done at work and made spicy pasta for dinner, now I just need to write some code before I call it a night

I'm not writing my best code, but i'm against the wall and should be getting ready for bed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/05/25

I just woke up and I feel amazing, that hammock is the best

no plans till 12-1 pm and then mom is gonna pick me up for dinner with grammy, hopefully we get back before 8pm tonight

just finished a couple lessons on class inheritance yesterday, I'm gonna think about that for a bit

6:53 PM -
    just got back from dinner with mom and grammy, we had a good time and dinner was delicious
    Spending time with family is good, not sure if i can do it all the time, I still think being alone most of the time is healthy for me right now, but dinner once a month is really good for me it seems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/04/25

Just got into work today, decided to walk, it's really nice out and by the time I get home I'll have already walked 5 miles

Just going to try and get some C++ under my belt and update the servers, then I'm headed back home.

I also need to write up a grocery list, but only the basic essentials, I'm spending as little money as possible after this point

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/03/25

Rought start to the day, but not too bumpy

Just need to survive till 5, then I can go home and put together my new hammock and relax

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/02/25

Today is starting strong, I've got a good feeling

Also, I might be getting my hammock today, probably tomorrow, but possibly today

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/01/25

Payment to capital one didn't go through until this morning, But I think the portion of my life I would describe as a struggle is coming to an end

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/30/25

Finally got paid, just waiting for the payment to capital one to go through.

maybe after this I'll be able to breath easier, if not, next month is the official last payment of real debt.

I have others, but they don't have interest or payments and are total $1700

Really fighting the urge to order chinese right now, but I don't need to be eating more today.

I think I'm gonna try to make a linked list

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/29/25

This month is taking forever, money is out, jobs are quiet
Today is starting off rough
and the AC is out at work
so my office is 90f rn



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/28/25

I might go overboard today on programming, I've got a wild hair to write a bunch of code but I'm already at 11 updates on git

I have 2 options, code without keeping track or saving any work, or risk dimming my squares and going wild

either way, today is already a good day, I'm gonna try going for a run later

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/27/25

god I wish I got paid already

semi-productive day, did some laundry & dishes, took down the dead tree in the yard and dug up the stump

I'm gonna try and go on a walk later tonight after dark


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/26/25

I've been running some numbers and if after basic bills I take everything I have left over, plus my bonus, I can pay off my 2500 credit card
in its entirety.
If I then keep my spending to an absolute minimum, then in November I can pay off what I put on the card for food & supplies in October & have
something left over to put into savings

This week has been amazing, my stress keeps dropping more everyday, & I think I might be a little happy

Also, I love the sound of ocean waves, they're very relaxing, especially with my noise cancelling headphones, really looking forward to pairing it with the hammock i'm getting

Got home, called dad, got a call from Bree, now I'm about to eat pizza and drink beer - Today is a really good day

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/25/25

Getting a lot done coding wise, just need to make sure I do actual work work today as well

I need to take a step away for a moment, chatgpt is pissing me off

ok, I think I know what I need, it'll be massively bloated and resource intensive, but I'm going to follow every possible path
and then return the length of the longest chain that works
originally I was following the path of the first item to work, but chatgpt pointed out that this was a greedy process and would occasionally skip possibilities
that could have been longer

I thought that I covered these possibilities by starting over with each individual item as the hos (head of snake), but it doesnt cover all later paths

The day is almost over and tomorrow is friday, I just need to get through 10 more hours before the weekend

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/24/25

I messed up yesterday, I forgot to finish my coding for the day, it was still a good day though.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/23/25

OK, today is a good day.

already got some excersize in, finished spanish early this morning, and made significant progress on bitlocker at work

just need to do some programming practice now

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/22/25

Works not so bad, not much happening yet but I've been focusing on programming challenges, looking up material on logic & design, and I also think
I found a hammock I'm gonna order next month

Pretty good day, It's flying by, survived a couple interviews and now there's only 30 minutes left

Currently working on the "Non-Divisible Subset" challenge, It's annoying, but I think I've got it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/21/25

I guess its been a good day, it wasn't bad

I definitly dont feel ready to go back to work tomorrow, but Ill go in and save my next sick day till later

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/20/25

Good day so far, got some weeding done and picked up poop in the back yard.

Practiced spanish

looking at some coding challenges next

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/19/25

Today was Addy's birthday, I went out to have dinner at Callie & Ben's house to celebrate. It was a good time.
I got to play with the kids and catch up talking about old times. I actually miss being out there.

It's right at the wire but I finished spanish lessons and already added some new code on github earlier today.

I implemented the code from yesterday and it worked on the first try.

I will try to do some more tonight but the rest will be tomorrow morning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/18/25

Sometimes nothing bothers me and other times life is falling apart, but when I look back on previous things I wrote it feels like I'm so dramatic. That's really annoying.

Learned something new yesterday that I havent had the chance to use yet.

ceiling() & floor()

    ceiling() returns the next hightest int
        example: ceiling(2.4) = 3, ceiling(5.1) = 6, ceiling(7.0) = 7

    floor() returns the next lowest int
        example: floor(2.4) = 2, floor(5.1) = 5, floor(7.0) = 7

    NOTE: the abreviations might be slightly off, but the definition stands.

I can apparently use this in my sherlock squares challenge.
If I need to find the amount of perfect squares between the numbers A & B, I just need to find the lowest and then the highest and count the number of whole int's between them

so if     A = 5
and       B = 19

then      find the ceiliing of the square root of 5 and subtract it from the floor of the square root of 19, and then add 1

        floor(sqrt(19))  = 4
        ceiling(sqrt(5)) = 3

                    4 - 3 + 1 = 2

        Between the numbers of 5 & 19 are 2 perfect squares

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/17/25

I need to keep my brain busy, Kat said she was coming to town this next weekend & the closer it gets the more she pops up in my thoughts
Eventually I'm gonna have to tell her to leave me alone, otherwise she's going to be hitting me up everytime she comes back.
upside, she doesnt come up all that often lately.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/16/25

I really need to work on my self discipline

I really have no idea how today went, I guess good? 

No, here, it just wasnt bad and it flew by. Also, I wrote up some notes on some code I want to work on, so in that sense it was kind of productive.

Also, a shit ton of meetings, but none of them were annoying

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/15/25

I need to get better about adding changes on here.

I'm going to write up something simple and small first just to maintain my streak.
And then I want to write a program that can save and load progress somehow? maybe with a doc file.

when I get home I need to wash and start soaking my pinto beans so I can cook them tomorrow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/14/25

Slow morning, but progress is being made, I need to go walk/run here soon so I have time to go a second time later tonight.

debating cooking rice vs ordering hometown china tonight.

Also, I need to remember to look into Server certifications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/13/25

walked 8.3 miles, I was even able to run a little, very little, but still it's progress

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/11/25

I feel pretty good today, but it's early & now that I'm thinking about it I feel like I'm on the edge of okay with a chance of falling
off into terrible

Multi-dimensional data coding:
    do I set it to 11 dimensions, or do I make it ask for a number at the start. I'll also need to setup some way to save and load previous sessions.
    Do all the dimensions overlap evenly? or do I limit them to tiers?
    would it just be pointers? or can I find a way to store information at each location?

    If I want it to be dynamic and the number of dimensions chose at the start each time it shouldn't be that hard to put together.

Maybe I need to chill on the multi-dimensional arrays, it's basically just a matrix of pointers and achieves nothing really.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/10/25

I thought I was done with this, but for the last 3 days it feels like I'm having a heart attack, just like before.
I blame it on getting drunk this last weekend, it's thrown off everything.

Ok, building on yesterdays thought on programming 3 dimensional data storage/handling.
    simulate the dimensions of reality in data storage?
    Like forget the game shit, just the manipulation of data in as many dimensions as reality?
    the capabilities of the virtual are not limited in the same ways we are.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/9/25

Work has been good, productive but not too busy.
After I get home I'm going to try to take a 1-mile walk early so I can start winding down for bed sooner. I was up way too late last night.

now, My one code idea for the day... one sec.

    3 dimensional data storage/handling for games?
        I'm imagining a side scroller where the player only sees the front layer, but what if the game kept track of the z axis too?
        IDK what for, it's already something people do, But thinking about how it works is all that's popping in my head right now.
        maybe I'll have a better thought for you later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/8/25 

Getting back on track, today I need to do the following
    - Get back X-rayed
    - Do Laundry
    - Run/Walk 4 miles
    - Cook Pasta
    - Go to bed before 10PM
----
Also I went ahead and reversed the order of my log entrys, it makes more sense to have the newest on top and push the older logs to the bottom
----
Before the end of the day I want to come up with an idea for something I want to do with programming. I may even make that a daily goal, One new programming idea per day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/7/25

I remember why I don't go out drinking, wasted the entire day today being hung-over

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/6/25

Been a good day so far, did server updates at the library this morning, got some groceries, had a nap and a glass of scotch, now I gotta get ready for work at murphys.

i'm gonna make some awesome pasta tomorrow night, I'm looking forward to it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/5/25

The day is almost over, I'm desperate for the weekend.

I'm going to get a pizza and maybe some scotch for tonight before it gets too late and then Ill go for a run before I cook the pizza. 
Tomorrow at 8AM I'll come in for a couple hours for server updates so I can't really stay up super late, but ill have time before we start to maybe work on some programming

Fuck My chest is killing me, why does it always feel like this on friday evenings?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/4/25

Got a decent amount of coding done yesterday got my car back, & had chinese food for dinner.
kind of started off in a good mood today, Ill try to hold onto that but I'm also looking into dating apps and that doesn't tend to end well.
gonna knock out some more coding today, I can definitly get the "sherlock & squares" challenge done at the very least.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/2/25

Car has been dropped off, my motivation is mostly non-existant, here in a sec I'm gonna go for a run and hopefully my brain will be cobweb free after that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/1/25

working:
  Factorials

current:
  Multiplication of decimals & fractionals

Next up: 
  update Factorials to handle decimals & fractionals
  Division

To-do:
  Addition
  Subtraction
  powers
  Square roots
  Connect all sub funtions with GUI

Speculative Ideas:
  remote use?

Doing a little work at the moment while I wake up and have some coffee, Then headed out to buy some supplies/clothes for work, will continue working on this after I get back.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8/30/25

Finally got myself to focus, The basic Abacus test function is finished and working.

I think I want to expand it into an entire math handling library, but that is a long term goal, for now Ill just settle on solving a few equations here and there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8/28/25

I don't know how much longer I can keep going


I can also use this place to list ideas for future coding projects

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is where I will be writing from now on, nothing specific, but hopefully mostly code related.

I havent had much motivation these last few days so I'm trying to make maintaining my streak on github as easy as possibl.

as long as I can maintain an unbroken streak, I can come back.

__________START HERE AND GO UP__________
