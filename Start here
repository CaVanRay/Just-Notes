This is where I will be writing from now on, nothing specific, but hopefully mostly code related.

I havent had much motivation these last few days so I'm trying to make maintaining my streak on github as easy as possibl.

as long as I can maintain an unbroken streak, I can come back.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can also use this place to list ideas for future coding projects

Finally got myself to focus, The basic Abacus test function is finished and working.

I think I want to expand it into an entire math handling library, but that is a long term goal, for now Ill just settle on solving a few equations here and there.

Car has been dropped off, my motivation is mostly non-existant, here in a sec I'm gonna go for a run and hopefully my brain will be cobweb free after that

Got a decent amount of coding done yesterday got my car back, & had chinese food for dinner.
kind of started off in a good mood today, Ill try to hold onto that but I'm also looking into dating apps and that doesn't tend to end well.
gonna knock out some more coding today, I can definitly get the "sherlock & squares" challenge done at the very least.
