This is where I will be writing from now on, nothing specific, but hopefully mostly code related.

I havent had much motivation these last few days so I'm trying to make maintaining my streak on github as easy as possibl.

as long as I can maintain an unbroken streak, I can come back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can also use this place to list ideas for future coding projects

I don't know how much longer I can keep going
